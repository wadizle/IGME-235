# Process:
I took a more top-down approach to creating this website and started by laying out the overall grid organization. I then went from section to section filling in content and then attempting to make it look better. Lastly, I added a few features to give the page a more responsive design.

# High Concept:
A twist on the classic game Perfection. Whenever a player successfully places a piece the rest of the slots randomly swap.

# Genre:
Action/Speed

# Story:
Place all the pieces in the correct slot before the time runs out!

# Aesthetics:
The game will be minimalist with basic graphics and sounds. Sounds will play upon picking up/placing pieces and if the user wins/runs out of time.

# Gameplay:
The user has sixty seconds to click and drag each shape to its corresponding slot. If the user correctly places a piece the remaining slots will shuffle and change locations. If the user manages to get all pieces to the correct location in time they win.

# About the Developer:
My name is Brandon Waddill, I am a second year majoring in Game Design and Development. My skills primarily lie in programming, espcially in languages such as C# and C. While I enjoy programming user experiences, I also love other aspects of coding such as database management with SQL.
