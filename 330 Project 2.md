# Overall:
Originally I was planning on giving each of my 3 songs a distinct look and feel but at the end of the day I focused on getting the requirements done before what I wanted. As such I am overall disappointed with my design as I do not feel it is overly special and it does not have the twist that I wanted it to have. That being said, I am relatively happy with certain parts of it and know I put a lot of effort in so I do not think I could have asked for much more out of myself. That being said, this project is a work in progress. I worked on the previous project for a few hours after turning it in last time but I suspect that I will work on this one for far longer.

#Requirements:
In general, I believe I hit the basic requirements of this assignment. While I do not think my code is as clean as my previous project, it is still relatively well organized and easy to follow. I spent a long time ensuring I was able to put all of the controls into the dat.gui interface, which was particularly fun for the song duration. The only thing I did not put into the dat.gui interface was the radio button that shows frequency and waveform data as I could not find a way to make radio buttons essentially making modified checkboxes. Along these lines, one area that I may lose points in is the waveform and frequency data itself and I did not really understand what information needed to be given to the user or in what form. Lastly, similar to my previous project, I feel like I have a distinct lack of a theme. While my original plan did contain a stronger theme, prioritizing the over requirements means I am likely to lose points here.

#Grade:
I think my overall code, media, and user experince are relatively decent and I expect to get a fair number of points in those sections. For the theme however, while I believe I made a decent looking audio visualizer, I believe it could be better. This probably places me somewhere in the low to mid B range.
