#Process:
At the beginning, I focused primarily on the backend of the projects, starting with the javascript and ensuring all the data was loaded and easily accessible. From there, I started to work away at the frontend, ensuring information was displayed in a way that made sense, was easy to use, and did not look horrible.

#Things To Look At:
Not quite sure what to say here as hopefully everything is relatively self explanitory. The least clear feature is that clicking on meals will result in another request to the API that gets more data and displays the information at the top of the page. The layout varies slightly depending on how many ingredients there are.

#How I Met the Requirements:
I went through both the project specification and the rubric carefully to ensure I addressed every section. In terms of functionality I added what was expected and more, I validated my css and html and ensured my JavaScript was as well commented as possible and lastly I spent a long time laying out my content in a way that looks decent (at least in my opinion).

#My Grade: 
If I was to give myself a grade, I would put myself in the mid A range. I believe I have met all of the requirements of the project including completing earlier milestones such as the proposal and the prototype. In addition, especially since I worked alone, I put a lot of time and effort into this project to make it how it is now especially in terms of appearence. This website looks better than any page I have made previously. All this would theoretically give me a 90 on the project. The last 10% would be the above and beyond portion. While I have gone beyond the requirements with the ability to make recipes "active" (with an accompanying increasing the the complexity of my JavaScript), I do not think I have made any extraordinary extra features. While I do no regret what I have made, I would likely only give myself a portion of the "above and beyond" points.
