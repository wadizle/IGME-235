Process:
At the beginning, I focused primarily on the backend of the projects, starting with the javascript and ensuring all the data was loaded and easily accessible. From there, I started to work away at the frontend, ensuring information was displayed in a way that made sense, was easy to use, and did not look horrible.

Things To Look At:

How I Met the Requirements:

My Grade: If I was to give myself a grade, I would put myself in the mid A range. I believe I have met all of the requirements of the project including completing earlier milestones such as the proposal and the prototype. In addition, especially since I worked alone, I put a lot of time and effort into this project to make it how it is now especially in terms of appearence. This website looks better than any page I have made previously. All this would theoretically give me a 90 on the project. The last 10% would be the above and beyond portion. While I have gone beyond the requirements with the ability to make recipes "active" (with an accompanying increasing the the complexity of my JavaScript), I do not think I have made any extraordinary extra features. While I do no regret what I have made, I would likely only give myself a portion of the "above and beyond" points.
