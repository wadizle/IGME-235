# Overall:
While I like the overall idea of my project, I do not think it turned out to be that great of an experince overall. In part, this is due to the fact that I spent more time than I expected working on the backend. For example, when I discovered I needed a custom class, I could have made some random class with no real importance to meet the requirements. Instead however, I chose to develop a backend to store the poem that was displayed. This was not important for the functionality of the site in any way, but developing a more robust backend was far more productive than creating a word class with little importance (other than meeting requirements). Other decisions and requirements resulted in similar stories, with me spending more time working on the code than the experience it created. In addition, I think my idea was difficult to make fun in the first place.

# Requirements/Grade:
I was more careful while going through the requirements for this project than the last one and as such should have my bases covered. I went through the requirements and wrote them down, crossing them off one at a time as I completed them. As such, I believe I would lose the majority of my points due to impact. Even though I feel as though I did a decent job with my code, I do not think it is far enough outside what we did in class to earn many points. In addition, the UI is not particularly great nor does it look particualarly "portfolio worthy". Given I am likely to get the majority of the points for the requirements and few for the impact, I would estimate my grade to be around a 90, although probably a few points lower than that.
